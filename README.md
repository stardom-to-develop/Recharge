  Recharge : It is a tool that generates random
  numbers to fill in the balance
  in the State of Iraq only
___________________________________
  This tool is dedicated to the city of Iraq 
___________________________________
• It supports all Iraq lines, which are:
1 Zain Iraq
2 Asiacell
3 Korek Telecom
___________________________________
  This tool works with random numbers
  So not all numbers are effective
  You will find the used, the expired and the active also
___________________________________
  These tools are written in Python 3 
  It does not work on previous versions of Python
  If you encounter a problem with running Python 3 
  pkg upgrade -y 
  pkg install python3
___________________________________
  The tools are durable and unbreakable
  User errors are handled automatically
  So don't worry about tools malfunctioning
  during extraction
___________________________________
  to start 
  $ python3 recharge.py
  Now choose the slide name according to the number
  After this, choose the number of codes formed
  After the codes appear, copy the entire code 
  Because I shortened the matter to you and
  put the order code before the card code
  So copy and paste into your calling app 
  And try your luck
___________________________________
  Important note:
  Not all codes are 100% working.
  It's just a matter of luck and choosing the
  numbers carefully
___________________________________
  A more important note than the one before:
  Don't try too many codes in too short a time
  Because this will expose you to the presence
  of the telecommunications company
